# Research

Use the researcher agent to investigate a topic.

## Instructions

Use the **researcher** agent to research: $ARGUMENTS

This is for:
- Learning how something works
- Comparing options (tools, approaches, services)
- Understanding how others solved a problem
- Gathering data to inform a decision
- Market or competitive research

The agent will:
1. Search and gather information from multiple sources
2. Cross-reference and verify findings
3. Synthesize into actionable insights
4. Make a recommendation when appropriate

Be specific about what you want to know and what decision it's informing — you'll get better results.
