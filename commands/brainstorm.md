# Brainstorm

Use the thought-partner agent as a thinking partner.

## Instructions

Use the **thought-partner** agent to help think through: $ARGUMENTS

This is for:
- Messy brain dumps that need untangling
- Half-formed ideas that need refining
- Topics you're still learning about
- Decisions you're wrestling with

The agent will:
1. Find the threads in your chaos
2. Reflect back what it's hearing
3. Ask questions to go deeper
4. Help you converge on clarity

Keep it conversational. You don't need to have your thoughts organized first — that's the point.
